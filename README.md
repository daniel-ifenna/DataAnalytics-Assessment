# DATA ANALYTICS- ASSESSMENT
## AUTHOR: Daniel Ifenna 
### Project Title: SQL Assessment Report

Problem Encountered: One of the major problems I had was uploading the SQL script as it was in the format UT-F 32BE. I used UT-F16, and it worked, and the tables were uploaded for analysis.
Working on this data, there was no provision such as `is_regular_savings=1`, so in getting the savings count, I wrote the query to count everyone who has a transaction status as successful and confirmed amount greater than 0
Also, the name column was empty, so i concatenated first name and last name and updated the name column to reflect the full name of each customer.
I also checked for duplicates in the dataset, and there were none present.
Working on this project was challenging for me. I am interested in your company not for the pay, but I want to learn. This position in data analytics is everything to me because i see how advanced we can take our country, your company by leveraging data
I know you will have more professional and skilled applicants. Even if I don't get the paid role, I am very much interested in coming in as an intern to learn
You may think I am selling myself short. But I place value in building first above others. 
It is my deepest desire to hear only good news from your company
Thank you for your time
